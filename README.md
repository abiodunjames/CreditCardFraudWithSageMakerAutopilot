# Training Models to Detect Credit Card Frauds with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot

This is the repository for a medium post on training models to detect online credit card frauds with Sagemaker Autopilot.


## Sagemaker Autopilot

Announced in 2019, [SageMaker Autopilot](https://medium.com/@samuelabiodun/training-a-model-to-detect-credit-card-fraud-with-amazon-sagemaker-autopilot-d49a6b667b2e) is Amazonâ€™s AutoML offering that allows you to build, train end-to-end ML models. It simplifies your tasks by exploring your data, finds the optimum algorithm that best suits your data, and prepares the data for model tuning and training. 

The autopilot generates notebooks for each trial as it tries to pick the best algorithm for your data. The notebooks provide detailed visibility into how data was wrangled as well as the model selection process. In addition, the notebooks contain educational materials that allow you to learn about the training process and how to train your own experiments. It indirectly teaches you theoretical knowledge.
